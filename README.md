## ✏️ Preface  

Artificial Intelligence is a vast and rapidly evolving field. While many resources exist, most focus on specific areas of AI, and a truly comprehensive and unified reference is hard to find. This book was created to fill that gap—a complete guide covering the full spectrum of AI topics, from basics to advanced concepts, all in one place.
